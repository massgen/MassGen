A new project just dropped called MassGen — it's a streaming-first orchestration framework that coordinates multiple LLM agents (OpenAI, Grok, Gemini, etc.) to solve tasks in parallel. Agents observe, learn from, and refine each other’s work in real-time. Inspired by Grok Heavy.

MassGen — an open-source multi-agent orchestration framework just launched. 
Supports cross-model collaboration (Grok, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) with real-time streaming and consensus-building among agents. Inspired by "parallel study groups" and Grok Heavy.

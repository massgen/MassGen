Hey @everyone,

As the founder of AutoGen & AG2, I'm incredibly excited to announce **MassGen**, a new open-source project developed in collaboration with several members of our community.

Many of you know that our work with AG2 pioneered multi-agent conversations. With MassGen, we're building on that foundation to explore a new pattern: the "parallel study group." Inspired by systems like Grok Heavy, MassGen orchestrates multiple agents (from Gemini, OpenAI, Grok, etc.) to tackle tasks simultaneously. They work in parallel, observe each other's progress in real-time, and collaboratively refine their approaches to find the best solution.

Our goal is to create a system that excels at:
- **ü§ù Cross-Model Synergy:** Leveraging the unique strengths of different frontier models working in concert.
- **‚ö° Parallel, Streaming Architecture:** Providing a highly responsive, real-time experience with live visualization.
- **üîÑ Natural Consensus:** Allowing a robust answer to emerge from observation and refinement.

This has been a fantastic collaborative effort, and we're launching it in its early stages because we want to continue building it *with* you, the community. We would love for you to check it out, share your feedback in #massgen, and help us shape this next step in agentic AI.

You can find the project on GitHub:

Thank you for being such an amazing community. We're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible, together.

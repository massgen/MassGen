# MassGen v0.1.7 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.1.7 focuses on agent task planning and rate limiting for improved multi-step coordination and API management.

- **Agent Task Planning System** (Required): üìã Enable agents to organize complex multi-step work with task plans and dependency tracking
- **Gemini Rate Limiting System** (Required): ‚ö° Multi-dimensional rate limiting to prevent API spam and manage costs

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Agent Task Planning System**: Complex multi-step workflows requiring task decomposition, dependency management, and coordinated execution
   **Use Case**: Multi-agent coordination for large projects with interdependent tasks

2. **Gemini Rate Limiting System**: Prevent API quota violations and manage costs while ensuring smooth operation
   **Use Case**: Enterprise deployments requiring cost control and API compliance

### üéØ Milestone 2: Gemini Rate Limiting System (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Multi-dimensional rate limiting for Gemini models to prevent API spam and manage costs

**Owner**: @AbhimanyuAryan (TBD on Discord)

**PR**: [#383](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/pull/383) (Draft)

#### 2.1 Rate Limiting Implementation
- [ ] Multi-dimensional rate limiting (RPM, TPM, RPD)
- [ ] Model-specific limits: Flash (9 RPM), Pro (2 RPM)
- [ ] Sliding window tracking for precise rate management
- [ ] Configurable limits via external YAML configuration
- [ ] Mandatory cooldown periods after agent startup

#### 2.2 Configuration System
- [ ] External YAML configuration for centralized limit control
- [ ] Optional `--rate-limit` CLI flag to enable/disable
- [ ] `enable_rate_limit` configuration parameter
- [ ] Model-specific rate limit profiles
- [ ] Dynamic rate limit adjustments

#### 2.3 Rate Tracking and Enforcement
- [ ] Sliding window tracking for RPM, TPM, RPD
- [ ] Request queuing when limits approached
- [ ] Automatic cooldown enforcement
- [ ] Rate limit violation detection and handling
- [ ] Logging and monitoring for rate limit events

#### 2.4 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test rate limiting accuracy
- [ ] Validate model-specific limits
- [ ] Stress testing with high request volumes
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting prevents API quota violations
- ‚úÖ Model-specific limits work correctly
- ‚úÖ Configuration is flexible and easy to use
- ‚úÖ Minimal impact on performance
- ‚úÖ Clear monitoring and debugging capabilities

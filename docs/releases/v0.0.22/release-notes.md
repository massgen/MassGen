## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v0.0.21

**Configuration Path Updates**

Configuration files have been reorganized. Update your paths:

**Old paths:**
```bash
massgen/configs/three_agents_gemini.yaml
massgen/configs/claude_mcp_test.yaml
```

**New paths:**
```bash
massgen/configs/teams/three_agents_gemini.yaml
massgen/configs/tools/mcp/claude_mcp_test.yaml
```

**Finding Configurations:**

Use the new organized structure:
- **Getting started?** Check `basic/` directory
- **Provider-specific?** Check `providers/<provider>/`
- **Using tools?** Check `tools/mcp/` or `tools/web_search/`
- **Multi-agent teams?** Check `teams/`

**No Breaking Changes:**

All existing absolute paths in your code will continue to work. Just update relative paths if needed.

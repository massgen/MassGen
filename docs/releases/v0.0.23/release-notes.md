# MassGen v0.0.23 Release Notes

**Release Date:** September 25, 2025

---

## Overview

Version 0.0.23 is a major **Backend Architecture Refactoring** release that consolidates MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality into a unified base class. This release dramatically reduces code duplication across backends while introducing a dedicated formatter module for message and tool formatting.

The refactoring removed nearly 2,000 lines of duplicated code while maintaining full backward compatibility and improving maintainability.

## What's New

### Backend Architecture Refactoring

**MCP Functionality Consolidation:**

The headline feature is the new **`base_with_mcp.py`** base class that consolidates common MCP functionality.

**Key Changes:**
- **New Base Class:** `base_with_mcp.py` (488 lines) consolidating shared MCP logic
- **Extracted MCP Logic:** Standardized MCP client initialization and error handling
- **Unified Error Handling:** Consistent MCP error handling across all backends
- **Reduced Duplication:** Removed ~1,932 lines of duplicated code

**Backend Reductions:**
- `chat_completions.py`: Reduced by 700+ lines
- `claude.py`: Reduced by 700+ lines
- `response.py`: Reduced by 468+ lines

**Benefits:**
- Easier to maintain MCP functionality
- Consistent behavior across backends
- Simpler to add new MCP features
- Less error-prone codebase

### Formatter Module

**Dedicated Message and Tool Formatting:**

New `massgen/formatter/` module with specialized formatters:

**Module Structure:**
- `message_formatter.py`: Handles message formatting across backends
- `tool_formatter.py`: Manages tool call formatting
- `mcp_tool_formatter.py`: Specialized MCP tool formatting

**Benefits:**
- Centralized formatting logic
- Consistent formatting across backends
- Easier to modify formatting rules
- Better separation of concerns

2. **Formatter Module:** New dedicated formatting module
3. **Frontend Display:** Improved coordination table handling

### Architecture Improvement

**Before:**
```
Each backend (claude.py, chat_completions.py, response.py, gemini.py)
  ├── Duplicated MCP initialization code
  ├── Duplicated MCP error handling
  ├── Duplicated MCP client management
  └── Duplicated tool formatting
```

**After:**
```
base_with_mcp.py (shared)
  ├── Unified MCP initialization
  ├── Unified MCP error handling
  └── Unified MCP client management

formatter/ (shared)
  ├── message_formatter.py
  ├── tool_formatter.py
  └── mcp_tool_formatter.py

Backends (claude.py, chat_completions.py, etc.)
  └── Inherits from base_with_mcp
```

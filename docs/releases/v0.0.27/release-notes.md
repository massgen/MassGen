## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v0.0.26

**No Breaking Changes**

v0.0.27 is fully backward compatible with v0.0.26. All existing configurations will continue to work.

**Optional: Enable Multimodal Features**

To use image generation and understanding:

1. **Use multimodal-capable models:**
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "vision_agent"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-4o"  # Supports vision
```

2. **For image generation:**
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "image_generator"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "dall-e-3"  # Image generation model
```

3. **For file search:**
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "doc_analyst"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-4o"
      # File search configured automatically
```

**Workspace Multimodal Tools**

The `read_multimodal_files` tool is automatically available when using MCP workspace tools.

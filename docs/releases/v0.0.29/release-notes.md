# MassGen v0.0.29 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 8, 2025

**Video Demo:** [MassGen v0.0.29 MCP Planning Mode](https://youtu.be/jLrMMEIr118)

---

## Overview

Version 0.0.29 introduces **MCP Planning Mode**, a groundbreaking coordination strategy that enables agents to plan MCP tool usage without execution during collaboration phases. This prevents irreversible actions during coordination while allowing full execution by the winning agent during final presentation.

Additionally, this release enhances file operation safety through read-before-delete enforcement and improves the permission system with better tracking capabilities.

---

## üöÄ What's New

### MCP Planning Mode

The headline feature of v0.0.29 is the new **MCP Planning Mode** coordination strategy.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Separation of Planning and Execution:** Agents plan tool usage during coordination without executing, preventing duplicate or premature irreversible actions
- **Multi-Backend Support:** Planning mode works across Response API, Chat Completions, and Gemini backends
- **CoordinationConfig Integration:** New `enable_planning_mode` flag with customizable planning mode instructions
- **Orchestrator & Frontend Support:** Full integration with coordination UI to display planning vs execution phases

**Implementation Details:**
- New `CoordinationConfig` class with `enable_planning_mode` configuration
- Backend enhancements in `base.py`, `response.py`, `chat_completions.py`, and `gemini.py`
- Gemini backend now supports session-based tool execution in planning mode
- Comprehensive test coverage in `test_mcp_blocking.py` and `test_gemini_planning_mode.py`

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
orchestrator:
  coordination:
    enable_planning_mode: true
    planning_mode_instruction: |
      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: You are currently in the coordination phase.
      During this phase:
      1. Describe your intended actions and reasoning
      2. Analyze other agents' proposals
      3. Use only 'vote' or 'new_answer' tools for coordination
      4. DO NOT execute any actual MCP commands
      5. Save execution for final presentation phase
```

**Try It Out:**
```bash
# Five agents with filesystem MCP in planning mode
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/tools/planning/five_agents_filesystem_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
  "Create a project structure for a Python web app"

# Five agents with Discord MCP in planning mode
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/tools/planning/five_agents_discord_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
  "Check recent messages and post a summary"
```

### File Operation Tracker

New **FileOperationTracker** system ensures safer file operations by enforcing read-before-delete policies.

**Key Features:**
- **Read-Before-Delete Enforcement:** Prevents agents from deleting files they haven't read first
- **Created File Exemption:** Agent-created files are exempt from read requirement (can delete their own files)
- **Directory Validation:** Comprehensive directory deletion validation with detailed error messages
- **Operation Tracking:** Tracks all read and write operations per agent

**Implementation:**
- New `FileOperationTracker` class in `filesystem_manager/_file_operation_tracker.py`
- Integration with `PathPermissionManager` for unified permission checking
- Methods: `track_read()`, `track_write()`, `validate_delete()`, `validate_batch_delete()`

**How It Works:**
```python
# Agent must read a file before deleting it
tracker.track_read(agent_id, file_path)  # Agent reads the file
tracker.validate_delete(agent_id, file_path)  # Now deletion is allowed

# Agent-created files can be deleted without reading
tracker.track_write(agent_id, new_file_path)  # Agent creates file
tracker.validate_delete(agent_id, new_file_path)  # Deletion allowed
```

---

### Path Permission Manager Enhancements

**PathPermissionManager** has been enhanced with FileOperationTracker integration.

**New Capabilities:**
- Operation tracking methods: `track_read_operation()`, `track_write_operation()`, `track_delete_operation()`
- Integration with `FileOperationTracker` for read-before-delete enforcement
- Enhanced delete validation for files and batch operations
- Extended test coverage in `test_path_permission_manager.py`

**Benefits:**
- Unified permission and operation tracking system
- Better safety guarantees for file operations
- Clearer error messages when operations are blocked

---

### Message Template Improvements

Enhanced multi-agent coordination guidance through improved message templates.

**Changes:**
- **Irreversible Actions Context:** Added `has_irreversible_actions` support for context path write access
- **Explicit Workspace Paths:** Temporary workspace path structure displayed for better agent understanding
- **Priority Hierarchy:** Clearer task handling priority and simplified new_answer requirements
- **Unified Evaluation:** Consistent evaluation guidance across coordination phases

**Impact:**
- Agents better understand workspace isolation
- Clearer coordination during planning mode
- Improved decision-making in multi-agent scenarios

---

### Enhanced MCP Tool Filtering

Multi-level filtering capabilities for fine-grained MCP tool control.

**Features:**
- **Backend-Level Filtering:** Filter tools at the backend configuration level
- **MCP-Server-Specific Filtering:** Override backend settings per MCP server with `allowed_tools`
- **Merged Exclusions:** Combined `exclude_tools` from both backend and MCP server configurations
- **Flexible Control:** Different agents can have different tool access to the same MCP server

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
backend:
  type: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  exclude_tools:
    - mcp__discord__discord_send_webhook_message  # Excluded at backend level
  mcp_servers:
    - name: "discord"
      allowed_tools:  # MCP-server-specific filtering
        - mcp__discord__discord_read_messages
        - mcp__discord__discord_send_message
```

**‚úÖ Enable Planning Mode When:**
- Using MCP tools with irreversible actions (Discord, Twitter, file operations)
- Multiple agents coordinating with external services
- You want agents to plan collaboratively before execution
- Preventing duplicate API calls during coordination

**‚ùå Planning Mode Not Needed When:**
- Single agent workflows
- Read-only MCP tools (weather, search)
- No coordination rounds (direct execution)

### Example Workflows

**Social Media Management:**
```bash
# Five agents plan tweet strategy, winner posts
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/tools/planning/five_agents_twitter_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
  "Analyze our brand voice and create an engaging tweet about our new feature"
```

**Team Communication:**
```bash
# Agents analyze Discord, plan response, winner posts
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/tools/planning/five_agents_discord_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
  "Check #support channel, summarize issues, post helpful guidance"
```

**Project Management:**
```bash
# Agents collaborate on file structure, winner implements
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/tools/planning/five_agents_filesystem_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
  "Create a FastAPI project with auth, database, and API endpoints"
```

## üöÄ Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v0.0.28

**No Breaking Changes**

v0.0.29 is fully backward compatible with v0.0.28. All existing configurations will continue to work.

**Optional: Enable Planning Mode**

To use the new planning mode feature:

1. Add coordination configuration to your existing config:
```yaml
orchestrator:
  coordination:
    enable_planning_mode: true
    planning_mode_instruction: |
      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: Describe your approach without executing tools.
      Use only 'vote' or 'new_answer' for coordination.
```

2. Your agents will now plan during coordination and execute during final presentation.

**File Operation Safety**

FileOperationTracker is automatically enabled - no configuration needed. Agents must now read files before deleting them (unless they created the file).

### Baseline Command
A baseline approach would use a single agent to handle the entire development process:

```bash
massgen --config basic/single/single_gpt5.yaml "Design and build a modern, responsive web UI for a 'MassGen Dashboard' that visualizes multi-agent coordination in real-time..."
```

<h2 id="evaluation-analysis">üîß Evaluation Analysis</h2>

### Results & Failure Modes

**Challenges with single-agent web UI development:**

1. **Limited Design Exploration**: A single agent typically produces one design approach without exploring alternatives
2. **Missing Accessibility Considerations**: Easy to overlook ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
3. **Incomplete Responsive Design**: Often optimizes for one viewport size without thorough testing across devices
4. **Architecture Trade-offs**: Single perspective on code organization, naming conventions, and scalability patterns
5. **Suboptimal User Experience**: Missing micro-interactions, loading states, error handling patterns that emerge from collaborative review

### Success Criteria

For this case study to demonstrate MassGen's value in web UI development:

1. **Multiple Design Approaches**: Agents explore different UI architectures and visual design systems
2. **Comprehensive Feature Coverage**: All 8 prompt requirements implemented with attention to detail
3. **Collaborative Refinement**: Agents critique and improve each other's designs through multiple iterations
4. **Production-Ready Quality**: Final output includes accessibility, performance optimization, and deployment readiness
5. **Consensus on Best Practices**: Agents converge on optimal patterns for responsive design, theming, and interactivity
6. **Working Demo**: Complete, functional UI that can be immediately opened and tested in a browser

<h2 id="desired-features">üéØ Desired Features</h2>

To successfully execute this collaborative web UI development case study, MassGen needs:

- **Filesystem Access with Workspace Isolation**: Agents need isolated workspaces to develop parallel implementations without conflicts
- **Code Execution Capabilities**: Agents should validate their HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementations
- **Multi-Agent Voting**: Coordination mechanism for agents to review and select the best design approach
- **Context Path Support**: Ability to deploy the winning implementation to a production-ready location
- **Web Search**: Access to current best practices, modern CSS techniques, and accessibility standards
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of agent collaboration to critique and improve designs

### Version
MassGen v0.0.22+ (with Advanced Filesystem Permissions and Workspace Copy capabilities)

<h3 id="new-features">‚ú® New Features</h3>

This case study leverages several MassGen capabilities to enable collaborative web UI development:

**1. Multi-Backend Orchestration**
- Agents from different providers (OpenAI GPT-5, Claude, Gemini) bring diverse design perspectives
- Each model has different strengths: GPT-5 for modern frameworks and UI patterns, Claude for clean architecture, Gemini for accessibility

**2. Isolated Workspace Development**
- Each agent develops in its own workspace directory (e.g., `agent_1_workspace/`, `agent_2_workspace/`)
- Parallel development eliminates conflicts and file overwrites
- Agents can explore different architectural approaches simultaneously

**3. Workspace Copy Tools (v0.0.22)**
- Winner agent uses `mcp__workspace_copy__copy_file` to deploy files from workspace to production
- Secure, auditable file transfers with permission validation
- Enables clean separation between development and deployment

**4. Context Path Permissions (v0.0.21)**
- Production directory specified in `context_paths` with configurable permissions
- Agents can read reference files but only winner can write to production
- Prevents unauthorized modifications while enabling collaboration

**5. Web Search Integration**
- Agents access current CSS techniques (CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables)
- Research accessibility standards (WCAG, ARIA best practices)
- Discover modern interaction patterns and animation libraries

**6. Consensus Voting Mechanism**
- Agents generate complete implementations
- Each agent reviews competitors' designs for architecture, UX, accessibility
- Voting determines which implementation best meets requirements

### New Config

Configuration file: `massgen/configs/case_studies/web_ui_collaborative_design.yaml`

### Command
```bash
massgen --config @examples/case_studies/web_ui_collaborative_design \
  "Design and build a modern, responsive web UI for a 'MassGen Dashboard' that visualizes multi-agent coordination in real-time. The dashboard should include: 1) A header with navigation and branding, 2) A main grid showing live agent cards with status indicators (thinking/generating/voting), 3) An interactive timeline visualization of the coordination process, 4) A comparison panel for viewing and voting on agent outputs, 5) Dark/light theme support with smooth transitions, 6) Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop), 7) Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), and 8) Modern animations and micro-interactions. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external frameworks. Include mock data for demonstration."
```

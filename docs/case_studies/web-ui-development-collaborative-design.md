### Prompt
The prompt tests multi-agent collaboration across the full web UI development lifecycle, requiring architecture planning, responsive design, interactive features, accessibility, and production deployment:

```
Design and build a modern, responsive web UI for a "MassGen Dashboard" that visualizes multi-agent coordination in real-time. The dashboard should include: 1) A header with navigation and branding, 2) A main grid showing live agent cards with status indicators (thinking/generating/voting), 3) An interactive timeline visualization of the coordination process, 4) A comparison panel for viewing and voting on agent outputs, 5) Dark/light theme support with smooth transitions, 6) Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop), 7) Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), and 8) Modern animations and micro-interactions. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external frameworks. Include mock data for demonstration.
```

### Baseline Config
Without MassGen's multi-agent coordination, developers would face:
- **Single perspective limitation**: One developer/agent making all architectural and design decisions
- **Sequential development**: Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment happening in isolation
- **Limited creativity**: Single approach without exploring alternative design patterns or implementation strategies
- **No peer review**: Missing the benefits of collaborative critique and refinement

### Baseline Command
A baseline approach would use a single agent to handle the entire development process:

```bash
massgen --config basic/single/single_gpt5.yaml "Design and build a modern, responsive web UI for a 'MassGen Dashboard' that visualizes multi-agent coordination in real-time..."
```

<h2 id="evaluation-analysis">üîß Evaluation Analysis</h2>

### Results & Failure Modes

**Challenges with single-agent web UI development:**

1. **Limited Design Exploration**: A single agent typically produces one design approach without exploring alternatives
2. **Missing Accessibility Considerations**: Easy to overlook ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
3. **Incomplete Responsive Design**: Often optimizes for one viewport size without thorough testing across devices
4. **Architecture Trade-offs**: Single perspective on code organization, naming conventions, and scalability patterns
5. **Suboptimal User Experience**: Missing micro-interactions, loading states, error handling patterns that emerge from collaborative review

### Success Criteria

For this case study to demonstrate MassGen's value in web UI development:

1. **Multiple Design Approaches**: Agents explore different UI architectures and visual design systems
2. **Comprehensive Feature Coverage**: All 8 prompt requirements implemented with attention to detail
3. **Collaborative Refinement**: Agents critique and improve each other's designs through multiple iterations
4. **Production-Ready Quality**: Final output includes accessibility, performance optimization, and deployment readiness
5. **Consensus on Best Practices**: Agents converge on optimal patterns for responsive design, theming, and interactivity
6. **Working Demo**: Complete, functional UI that can be immediately opened and tested in a browser

<h2 id="desired-features">üéØ Desired Features</h2>

To successfully execute this collaborative web UI development case study, MassGen needs:

- **Filesystem Access with Workspace Isolation**: Agents need isolated workspaces to develop parallel implementations without conflicts
- **Code Execution Capabilities**: Agents should validate their HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementations

<h2 id="evaluation-design">📝 Evaluation Design</h2>

### Prompt
"Create a presentation that teaches a reinforcement learning algorithm and output it in LaTeX Beamer format. No figures should be added."

### Configuration

Prior to v0.0.16, Gemini agents had no filesystem access capabilities, making them unable to create files or collaborate with Claude Code agents that rely on workspace sharing.

```yaml
agents:
  - id: "gemini_agent"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-pro"

  - id: "claude_code"
    backend:
      type: "claude_code"
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
      cwd: "claude_code_workspace"

orchestrator:
    snapshot_storage: "snapshots"  # Directory to store workspace snapshots
    agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"  # Directory for temporary agent workspaces

ui:
  display_type: "rich_terminal"
  logging_enabled: true
```

### Baseline Command
```bash
uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/tools/mcp/gemini_mcp_filesystem_test_with_claude_code.yaml "Create a presentation that teaches a reinforcement learning algorithm and output it in LaTeX Beamer format. No figures should be added."
```

<h2 id="evaluation-analysis">🔧 Evaluation Analysis</h2>

### Previous Limitations
Before v0.0.16, MassGen had fundamental disparities between backends:

1. **Filesystem Access Gap**: Only Claude Code agents had built-in filesystem tools (Read, Write, Edit, etc.)
2. **No Cross-Backend Collaboration**: Gemini agents couldn't participate in file-based workflows
3. **Workspace Isolation**: No shared workspace management between different backend types
4. **Limited MCP Filesystem Integration**: No unified approach to filesystem operations via MCP

### Success Criteria
The unified filesystem support would be considered successful if:

1. **Backend Parity**: Gemini agents gain equivalent filesystem capabilities to Claude Code agents
2. **Cross-Backend Workspace Sharing**: Seamless file sharing between Gemini and Claude Code agents
3. **MCP Integration**: Clean MCP-based filesystem operations for extensibility
4. **Unified Configuration**: Identical `cwd` and workspace configuration syntax across backends
5. **Collaborative Workflows**: Multi-backend agents working on shared files and projects

<h2 id="desired-features">🎯 Desired Features</h2>

1. **FilesystemManager Class**: Unified filesystem management for all backends with MCP integration
2. **Cross-Backend Workspace Sharing**: Automatic workspace synchronization between different agent types
3. **Identical Configuration Syntax**: Same `cwd` parameter support for Gemini as Claude Code
4. **MCP-Based File Operations**: Clean abstraction layer for filesystem operations through MCP protocol
5. **Enhanced Orchestration**: Intelligent workspace management and agent coordination

Key breakthrough - **identical filesystem configuration across backends**:
```yaml
agents:
  - id: "gemini_agent"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
      cwd: "workspace1"  # NEW: Gemini now supports cwd like Claude Code

  - id: "claude_code"
    backend:
      type: "claude_code"
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
      cwd: "workspace2"  # Existing: Claude Code filesystem support

orchestrator:
    snapshot_storage: "snapshots"
    agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"
```

### Command
```bash
uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/tools/mcp/gemini_mcp_filesystem_test_with_claude_code.yaml "Create a presentation that teaches a reinforcement learning algorithm, and output it in LaTeX Beamer format. No figures are required."
```

<h2 id="agents">🤖 Agents</h2>

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Gemini Agent**: `gemini-2.5-pro` with MCP filesystem capabilities via FilesystemManager
- **Claude Code Agent**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` with native filesystem tools

**Workspace Setup (Orchestrator-Managed):**
- **gemini_agent**: `workspace1` (main workspace), `temp_workspaces/gemini_agent` (shared context workspace)
- **claude_code**: `workspace2` (main workspace), `temp_workspaces/claude_code` (shared context workspace)
- **Orchestrator**: Creates and manages `temp_workspaces/` for all agents, maintains `snapshots/` for state preservation, handles automatic cross-agent workspace synchronization

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<h3 id="unified-filesystem-manager">🗂️ Unified Filesystem Manager - The Core Innovation</h3>

**Major Breakthrough**: Introduction of the `FilesystemManager` class provides unified filesystem access (currently implemented for Gemini and Claude Code backends, with architecture designed for future expansion).

**Key Evidence from Logs:**
```
02:20:42 | INFO | [FilesystemManager.setup_orchestration_paths] Called for agent_id=gemini_agent, snapshot_storage=snapshots, agent_temporary_workspace=temp_workspaces
02:20:42 | INFO | [FilesystemManager.setup_orchestration_paths] Called for agent_id=claude_code, snapshot_storage=snapshots, agent_temporary_workspace=temp_workspaces
```

**Implementation:**
- **Backend-Agnostic Design**: Same filesystem interface for all backend types
- **MCP Integration**: Gemini agents now use MCP filesystem servers for file operations
- **Workspace Management**: Automatic workspace creation, cleanup, and path management
- **Permission System**: Inherited security model from Claude Code backend

**Impact:**
- Gemini agents can now create, read, write, and manipulate files just like Claude Code agents
- Consistent workspace behavior across different backend types
- Extensible foundation for adding filesystem support to any future backend

<h3 id="cross-backend-workspace-sharing">🤝 Cross-Backend Workspace Sharing</h3>

**Revolutionary Capability**: First-time cross-backend collaboration with shared workspace access.

**Key Evidence:**
```
[SYSTEM_FULL] ## Filesystem Access

You have access to filesystem operations through MCP tools allowing you to read and write files.

### Your Accessible Directories:

1. **Your Main Workspace**: `/workspace2`
 - IMPORTANT: ALL your own work (like writing files and creating outputs) MUST be done in your working directory.

2. **Context Workspace**: `/temp_workspaces/claude_code`
 - Context: You have access to a reference temporary workspace that contains work from yourself and other agents for REFERENCE ONLY.
```

**Collaborative Workflow:**
1. **Separate Main Workspaces**: Each agent has their own working directory for creating original work
2. **Shared Context Workspace**: All agents can access a temporary workspace containing work from all agents
3. **Automatic Synchronization**: Orchestrator manages workspace snapshots and sharing
4. **Cross-Backend File Access**: Claude Code can read Gemini's LaTeX files, and vice versa

**Result:**
- Claude Code agent successfully accessed and analyzed Gemini's Q-learning presentation
- Intelligent combination of both agents' work into a comprehensive final presentation
- Seamless collaboration despite different backend implementations

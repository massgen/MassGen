## The Collaborative Process

### Comprehensive Coverage Strategy
Each agent approached the exhaustive enumeration request by systematically covering different algorithmic categories:

**Agent 1 (gpt-5-nano-1, minimal reasoning)** provided foundational coverage:
- Classical approaches: naive recursion, memoization, dynamic programming
- Optimization techniques: space-optimized variants
- Fast algorithms: matrix exponentiation, fast doubling
- Mathematical approaches: closed-form solutions, generating functions
- Practical considerations: big integer arithmetic, language-specific implementations

**Agent 2 (gpt-5-nano-2, medium reasoning)** offered structured categorization:
- Organized by time/space complexity characteristics
- Included modular arithmetic variants
- Covered specialized techniques: Pisano periods, parallel computation
- Provided practical implementation guidance and benchmarking suggestions

**Agent 3 (gpt-5-nano-3, high reasoning)** delivered advanced mathematical coverage:
- Sophisticated algorithms: Kitamasa method, Bostan-Mori algorithm
- Algebraic approaches: Lucas number relations, polynomial exponentiation
- Combinatorial interpretations: Zeckendorf representation, tiling methods
- Specialized contexts: modular arithmetic, precomputation strategies

### Progressive Recognition of Superiority
The voting process revealed a clear progression in comprehensiveness:

1. **Initial Self-Assessment:** Agent 2 initially voted for itself, recognizing its well-organized approach
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Agent 1 recognized Agent 3's superior breadth, voting for the most comprehensive collection
3. **Advanced Technique Recognition:** Both Agent 2 and Agent 3 acknowledged Agent 3's inclusion of advanced algorithms like Kitamasa and Bostan-Mori

### The Unanimous Final Consensus
All three agents converged on Agent 3's answer, with unanimous recognition (3/3 votes) based on:

**Breadth Criteria:** Agent 3 included "advanced techniques (Kitamasa, Bostanâ€“Mori, etc.) and modular variants, which better satisfies 'as many ways as possible'"

**Systematic Coverage:** The answer provided "the most comprehensive and diverse set of Fibonacci computation methods, including classic and advanced approaches"

**Practical Value:** Integration of theoretical algorithms with implementation guidance and performance considerations

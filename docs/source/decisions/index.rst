Architecture Decision Records
============================

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

Why ADRs?
---------

* **Context preservation**: Understand why decisions were made 6 months from now
* **Avoid re-litigation**: Don't endlessly debate already-decided questions
* **Onboarding**: New contributors can quickly understand project rationale
* **Transparency**: All stakeholders see the decision-making process

How to Write an ADR
-------------------

Use the `template <../_templates/adr-template.md>`_ to document significant technical decisions:

* Framework choices
* Architecture patterns
* Data format decisions
* API design approaches
* Testing strategies

Status Definitions
------------------

* **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
* **Accepted**: Decision made and being implemented
* **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not chosen
* **Superseded**: Replaced by a later decision
* **Deprecated**: No longer relevant

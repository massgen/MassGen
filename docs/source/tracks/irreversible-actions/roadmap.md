## ðŸ’¬ Quick Notes

**This Week:**
- Working on parallel execution safety mechanisms
- Addressing minority voting problem for dangerous actions

**Next Week:**
- Security audit planning
- Rollback mechanism design review

**Decisions Needed:**
- Should rollback be automatic or manual?
- How long to keep rollback snapshots?
- User confirmation UX for dangerous operations

**Known Risks:**
- **High:** Path traversal, credential leakage, data destruction
- **Medium:** Resource exhaustion, infinite loops
- **Low:** Log tampering, permission bypass

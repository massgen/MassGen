# Irreversible Actions Track - Roadmap

**Timeline:** Next 3-6 months

**Last Updated:** 2024-10-08

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (Weeks 1-4)

### Rollback & Recovery
- **Goal:** Enable safe experimentation with undo capability
- **Deliverables:**
  - File operation snapshots
  - Rollback command/API
  - Automated cleanup
  - User documentation

### User Confirmation Flow
- **Goal:** Prevent accidental dangerous operations
- **Deliverables:**
  - Confirmation prompts for risky operations
  - Batch approval option
  - Whitelist/blacklist configuration
  - Integration with all UI modes

---

## 📈 Medium-Term Goals (Weeks 5-12)

### Enhanced Permission System (Q1 2025)
- **Goal:** More granular, flexible permissions
- **Deliverables:**
  - Per-operation permissions (read, write, delete, execute)
  - Time-limited permissions
  - Conditional permissions (e.g., if file size < 1MB)
  - Permission templates

### Workspace Quotas (Q1 2025)
- **Goal:** Prevent resource exhaustion
- **Deliverables:**
  - File size limits
  - File count limits
  - Total workspace size limits
  - Quota warnings and enforcement

### Secret Detection (Q2 2025)
- **Goal:** Prevent credential leakage
- **Deliverables:**
  - Auto-detect API keys, passwords
  - Block agent access to secrets
  - Secure credential store integration
  - Rotation recommendations

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision (3-6 months)

### Complete Sandboxing
Isolate agent operations completely:
- **Filesystem:** chroot/Docker container
- **Network:** Isolated network namespace
- **Process:** Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- **System:** No system call access

### Formal Verification
Prove safety properties:
- Mathematical proof of permission system
- Automated test generation
- Formal spec of safe operations
- Verification of implementation

### Trust & Reputation
Agent behavior tracking:
- Track agent reliability
- Learn from past behavior
- Adjust permissions dynamically
- Community reputation system

---

## 🔍 Research Areas

### Security Architecture
- Zero-trust security model
- Capability-based security
- Least privilege automation
- Security by design patterns

### Performance vs. Safety
- Minimize security overhead
- Efficient permission checking
- Fast rollback mechanisms
- Streaming safe operations

### User Experience
- Make safety non-intrusive

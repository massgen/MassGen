# Irreversible Actions Track - Details & Architecture

**This document contains:** Long-term vision, architecture decisions, detailed planning, metrics, and dependencies

## 📐 Architecture

### Permission System

**Path Permissions:**

```yaml
filesystem:
  protected_paths:
    - path: "important_data/"
      permission: "read"         # Read-only
    - path: ".git/"
      permission: "none"         # No access
  context_paths:
    - path: "src/"
      permission: "read"         # Read-only source
```

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Protected path enforcement
- ✅ Permission validation before operations
- ✅ Operation tracking and logging
- ✅ Read-before-delete enforcement (v0.0.29)
- 🔄 Rollback mechanisms (in progress)

### File Operation Tracker

**Code:** `massgen/filesystem_manager/_file_operation_tracker.py`

**Features:**
- Log all filesystem operations
- Track which agent performed action
- Timestamp all operations
- Enable audit trail
- Read-before-delete enforcement

### Path Permission Manager

**Code:** `massgen/filesystem_manager/_path_permission_manager.py`

**Features:**
- Check permissions before operations
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Support for wildcards and patterns
- Hierarchical permission inheritance

### Security Model

**Principles:**
1. **Least Privilege:** Agents get minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of protection
3. **Fail Safe:** Default to deny access
4. **Audit Trail:** Log everything for accountability
5. **User Control:** User can override when needed

**Trust Boundaries:**
- **Workspace:** Agent has full control
- **Context Paths:** Read-only access
- **Protected Paths:** Restricted or no access
- **System:** No access by default

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision (3-6 Months)

### Complete Sandboxing

Isolate agent operations completely:

**Filesystem:** chroot/Docker container
**Network:** Isolated network namespace
**Process:** Resource limits (CPU, memory)
**System:** No system call access

### Formal Verification

Prove safety properties:
- Mathematical proof of permission system
- Automated test generation
- Formal spec of safe operations
- Verification of implementation

### Trust & Reputation

Agent behavior tracking:
- Track agent reliability
- Learn from past behavior
- Adjust permissions dynamically
- Community reputation system

## 📈 Medium-Term Goals (Weeks 5-12)

### Enhanced Permission System (Q1 2025)

**Goal:** More granular, flexible permissions

**Deliverables:**
- Per-operation permissions (read, write, delete, execute)
- Time-limited permissions
- Conditional permissions (e.g., if file size < 1MB)
- Permission templates

### Workspace Quotas (Q1 2025)

**Goal:** Prevent resource exhaustion

**Deliverables:**
- File size limits
- File count limits
- Total workspace size limits
- Quota warnings and enforcement

### Secret Detection (Q2 2025)

**Goal:** Prevent credential leakage

**Deliverables:**
- Auto-detect API keys, passwords
- Block agent access to secrets
- Secure credential store integration
- Rotation recommendations

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Pre-Operation Validation

1. **Permission Check:** Verify agent has permission
2. **Path Validation:** Ensure path is safe
3. **Operation Type:** Validate operation is allowed
4. **Confirmation:** Request user confirmation (if configured)

### Post-Operation Tracking

1. **Log Operation:** Record what happened
2. **State Snapshot:** Capture before/after state
3. **Rollback Point:** Enable undo if needed

### Dangerous Operations

Currently blocked or require confirmation:
- Deleting files outside workspace
- Modifying system files
- Accessing credentials/secrets
- Network operations (future)
- Code execution (future, with sandbox)

## 🛠️ Technical Debt

### High Priority
- Security audit needed
- Penetration testing
- Threat model documentation

### Medium Priority
- Rollback implementation
- Permission system refactoring
- Test coverage for edge cases

### Low Priority
- Performance profiling
- Error message improvements
- Documentation polish

---

## 🔄 Review Schedule

- **Weekly:** Security issues, vulnerability reports
- **Monthly:** Permission system review, audit log analysis
- **Quarterly:** External security audit, threat model update
- **Annually:** Major security assessment

---

## 🚨 Incident Response Plan

### If Security Issue Found:

1. **Contain:** Isolate affected systems
2. **Assess:** Understand scope and impact
3. **Fix:** Patch vulnerability immediately
4. **Test:** Verify fix works
5. **Disclose:** Coordinated disclosure
6. **Learn:** Post-mortem, improve

### Severity Levels:

- **Critical:** Can cause data loss/exposure
- **High:** Can bypass safety mechanisms
- **Medium:** Could lead to issues under specific conditions
- **Low:** Theoretical or difficult to exploit

## 📝 Decision Log

### 2025-01-15: Read-Before-Delete Enforcement
**Decision:** Implement FileOperationTracker to prevent accidental deletions
**Rationale:** Agents must review files before deleting (except their own creations)
**Status:** Implemented in v0.0.29
**Impact:** Zero accidental file deletions since implementation

### 2024-09-20: Protected Paths Strategy
**Decision:** Implement read-only paths within writable context paths
**Rationale:** Fine-grained control over critical files
**Alternatives Considered:** Block access entirely (too restrictive)

---

**Responsible Disclosure:** If you find a security vulnerability, do not create a public issue. Email security contact with details and reproduction steps.

## üìê Architecture

### Filesystem Manager

```
massgen/filesystem_manager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _filesystem_manager.py         # Main filesystem interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _workspace_tools_server.py     # MCP server for workspaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _path_permission_manager.py    # Permission enforcement
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _file_operation_tracker.py     # Operation logging
```

### Key Components

**Workspace Isolation:** Each agent has separate workspace
**Permission System:** Fine-grained control over file access
**Operation Tracking:** Log all filesystem operations
**Safety Checks:** Prevent dangerous operations

### MCP Tools Integration

**Supported MCP Servers:**
- ‚úÖ Discord MCP (bot operations)
- ‚úÖ Twitter MCP (tweet analysis)
- ‚úÖ Notion MCP (database operations)
- ‚úÖ Filesystem MCP (file operations)
- ‚úÖ Multi-MCP coordination

**Examples:** 57+ configurations in `massgen/configs/tools/mcp/`

### Web Automation

**Playwright Integration (Experimental):**
- Multi-agent browser automation
- Screenshot analysis for debugging
- Example: `massgen/configs/tools/code-execution/multi_agent_playwright_automation.yaml`

## üéì Technical Details

### Current Capabilities

**Filesystem Operations:**
- Workspace-isolated file operations
- Context paths (read-only access)
- Protected paths (write restrictions)
- File operation tracking
- Permission management

**Configuration Example:**

```yaml
agents:
  - id: "coding_agent"
    backend:
      type: "claude_code"
      model: "claude-sonnet-4"
      cwd: "workspace"           # Isolated workspace

orchestrator:
  snapshot_storage: "snapshots"
  agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"
  context_paths:
    - path: "src/"
      permission: "read"         # Read-only access to source
```

**Planning Mode:**

```yaml
orchestrator:
  coordination:
    enable_planning_mode: true
    planning_mode_instruction: |
      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: Describe your approach without executing.
```

### Key Challenges

1. **Security:** Preventing agents from accessing/modifying sensitive files
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Multiple agents working on same files
3. **Error Recovery:** Failed operations leave inconsistent state
4. **Performance:** Filesystem operations can be slow

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt

### High Priority
- Refactor filesystem manager (growing complex)
- Improve error handling consistency
- Add comprehensive integration tests

### Medium Priority
- Workspace cleanup automation
- File operation history database
- Better logging infrastructure

### Low Priority
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection
- Code documentation

---

## üîÑ Review Schedule

- **Weekly:** PR reviews, bug triage
- **Bi-weekly:** Security review
- **Monthly:** Roadmap adjustment
- **Quarterly:** Major feature planning

---

## üìù Decision Log

### 2025-01-15: Planning Mode Enhancement
**Decision:** Extend planning mode to more backends (Gemini)
**Rationale:** Prevents irreversible actions during coordination
**Status:** Implemented in v0.0.29

### 2024-10-08: Read-Before-Delete Safety
**Decision:** Implement FileOperationTracker to prevent accidental deletions
**Rationale:** Agents must review files before deleting
**Status:** Implemented in v0.0.29

### 2024-09-15: MCP Integration Strategy
**Decision:** Support MCP protocol for tool integration
**Rationale:** Industry standard, extensible, community support
**Alternatives Considered:** Custom tool format (less flexible)

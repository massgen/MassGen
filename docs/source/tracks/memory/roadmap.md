## ðŸ’¬ Quick Notes

**This Week:**
- Designing context window management strategy
- Testing multi-turn scenarios

**Next Week:**
- Implement truncation-based context management
- Add context limit warnings

**Decisions Needed:**
- Context strategy: Truncation vs. Summarization vs. Selective?
- Should sessions be encrypted by default?
- Auto-cleanup: Age-based or size-based?

**Metrics:**
- Configurations with multi-turn: 10+
- Longest conversation: 15 turns (in testing)
- Session file size: Average 500KB, max 2MB
- Session save/load/recovery success: 100%

**Known Issues:**
- No context window overflow protection (High)
- Large session files not compressed (High)
- No warning when approaching context limits (High)

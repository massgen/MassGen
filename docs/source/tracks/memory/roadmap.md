## üìà Medium-Term Goals (Weeks 5-12)

### Automatic Summarization (Q1 2025)
- **Goal:** Intelligent context compression
- **Deliverables:**
  - Summarize old conversation context
  - Preserve key information
  - Configurable summarization strategy
  - Cost-aware (API calls for summarization)

### Cross-Session Context (Q1-Q2 2025)
- **Goal:** Agents remember across sessions
- **Deliverables:**
  - Session linking
  - Context carryover
  - Semantic search across sessions
  - Privacy controls

### Shared Memory (Q2 2025)
- **Goal:** Agents learn from each other
- **Deliverables:**
  - Shared memory pool
  - Agent-specific vs. shared context
  - Memory synchronization
  - Access controls

## üöÄ Long-Term Vision (3-6 months)

### Semantic Memory System
Vector-based memory for rich context:
- **Storage:** Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Retrieval:** Semantic search for relevant context
- **Scaling:** Handle millions of interactions
- **Learning:** Agents improve from past experiences

### Episodic Memory
Remember specific interactions:
- **Episodes:** Discrete interaction memories
- **Indexing:** By time, topic, success/failure
- **Recall:** Retrieve relevant episodes
- **Learning:** Pattern recognition from episodes

### Memory-Augmented Generation
Use memory to improve responses:
- **Retrieval-Augmented:** Fetch relevant memories
- **Context-Aware:** Understand conversation history
- **Adaptive:** Learn user preferences
- **Personalized:** Remember user-specific details

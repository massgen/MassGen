# Multimodal Track - Roadmap

**Timeline:** Next 3-6 months

**Last Updated:** 2024-10-08

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (Weeks 1-4)

### Image Understanding Consolidation
- **Goal:** Ensure consistent image understanding across all vision-capable backends
- **Deliverables:**
  - Comprehensive testing suite for vision capabilities
  - Documentation of backend-specific limitations
  - Example configurations for common use cases

### Image Generation Enhancement
- **Goal:** Expand image generation support
- **Deliverables:**
  - DALL-E 3 configuration guide
  - Cost optimization for image generation
  - Error handling and retry logic

---

## 📈 Medium-Term Goals (Weeks 5-12)

### Video Understanding (Q1 2025)
- Enable agents to process video content
- Support Gemini 1.5's native video understanding
- Use cases: Video analysis, content moderation, video Q&A

### Audio Modality Support (Q1 2025)
- Speech-to-text integration
- Audio generation (TTS)
- Multi-agent voice conversations

### Multimodal Tool Coordination (Q2 2025)
- Agents can request specific modalities from each other
- Visual tool outputs (charts, diagrams, screenshots)
- Coordinated multimodal workflows

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision (3-6 months)

### Rich Multimodal Agents
Agents that seamlessly work across text, images, audio, and video:
- **Visual Coding Agent:** Screenshots for debugging, diagram generation
- **Data Analysis Agent:** Generate charts, process visualizations
- **Content Creation Agent:** Generate images to accompany text

### Cross-Modal Understanding
- Agent A describes image, Agent B generates matching visualization
- Audio transcription → Text analysis → Visual summary
- Video understanding → Text summary → Image highlights

### Local Model Support
- Stable Diffusion for image generation
- Whisper for speech recognition
- Local video processing models

---

## 🔍 Research Areas

### Performance Optimization
- Image compression for faster transmission
- Caching strategies for repeated visual queries
- Batch processing for multiple images

### Cost Management
- Token usage tracking for vision APIs
- Image resolution optimization
- Smart caching to reduce API calls

### Quality Assurance
- Vision accuracy benchmarking
- Generation quality metrics
- Cross-backend consistency testing

---

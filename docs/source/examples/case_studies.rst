Case Studies
============

Real-world MassGen case studies demonstrating multi-agent collaboration on complex tasks.

.. note::

   These case studies are based on actual MassGen sessions with real session logs and outcomes.

Overview
--------

Each case study includes:

* **Problem description** - The task or question given to agents
* **Configuration used** - YAML config and CLI command
* **Agent collaboration** - How agents worked together
* **Final outcome** - Results and quality assessment
* **Session logs** - Actual coordination history and voting patterns

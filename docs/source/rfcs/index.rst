Request for Comments (RFCs)
============================

RFCs are design proposals for significant features or changes to MassGen. They facilitate discussion and consensus before implementation begins.

What is an RFC?
---------------

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a design document that:

* Proposes a significant new feature or change
* Explains the motivation and use cases
* Describes the technical design in detail
* Considers alternatives and tradeoffs
* Solicits feedback from the community

When to Write an RFC
--------------------

Write an RFC when:

* The feature affects multiple tracks or components
* The change is architecturally significant
* The implementation will take more than 2 weeks
* The feature has multiple viable approaches to discuss
* Community input would improve the design

**Don't write an RFC for:**

* Small bug fixes
* Minor improvements
* Well-understood features with clear implementation
* Internal refactoring that doesn't affect APIs

RFC Process
-----------

1. **Draft**: Author creates RFC using the `template <../_templates/rfc-template.md>`_
2. **Discussion**: RFC opened as Pull Request for community feedback
3. **Revision**: Author incorporates feedback and refines design
4. **Decision**: Track leads and maintainers approve or request changes
5. **Acceptance**: RFC merged when consensus reached
6. **Implementation**: Feature developed according to RFC design
7. **Closure**: RFC marked as Implemented when feature ships

Active RFCs
-----------

No active RFCs at this time.

Once RFCs are submitted, they will be listed here with their status, author, and affected tracks.

Accepted RFCs
-------------

No accepted RFCs yet - this is a new process!

Accepted RFCs will be listed here once they are implemented, along with related Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Rejected RFCs
-------------

No rejected RFCs yet.

Rejected RFCs will be documented here with the reasoning behind the decision.

Templates and Guidelines
------------------------

* `RFC Template <../_templates/rfc-template.md>`_
* See existing case studies for examples of well-documented features
* Follow the case study template for evaluation design

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
{CONFIG_KEY_1}: {CONFIG_VALUE_1}

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
{CONFIG_KEY_2}: {CONFIG_VALUE_2}

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Example: {EXAMPLE_SCENARIO}
```

### Notes

{RESULT_METRIC_2} is {RESULT_VALUE_2},
an improvement of {IMPROVEMENT_PERCENTAGE}.

{ADDITIONAL_RESULT_COMMENTARY}
```

#### On-Screen Commands

```bash
# Show results
cat {RESULT_FILE}

# Display metrics
{METRICS_COMMAND}
```

#### Captions

```srt
18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000

### Part 3: Advanced Features (3:15-4:00)

#### Visual

- Terminal showing advanced options
- Split screen if comparing features
- Highlight different output

#### Narration

```
The feature also includes advanced capabilities.

For example, you can use {ADVANCED_OPTION_1}
to {ADVANCED_PURPOSE_1}.

Or {ADVANCED_OPTION_2} for {ADVANCED_PURPOSE_2}.

This flexibility allows {ADVANCED_BENEFIT}.
```

#### On-Screen Commands

```bash
# Advanced usage
{ADVANCED_COMMAND_1}

# Alternative approach
{ADVANCED_COMMAND_2}
```

#### Captions

```srt
22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000

## Comparison with Previous Version (4:00-5:00)

### Visual

- Side-by-side comparison (if possible)
- Or before/after sequence
- Table or chart showing differences
- Highlight improvements

### Narration

```
Let's compare this with version {PREVIOUS_VERSION}.

In the previous version, {OLD_APPROACH_DESCRIPTION}.
This took {OLD_TIME} and produced {OLD_RESULT}.

With version {VERSION}, {NEW_APPROACH_DESCRIPTION}.
This now takes only {NEW_TIME} and produces {NEW_RESULT}.

That's a {IMPROVEMENT_PERCENTAGE} improvement in {IMPROVEMENT_METRIC}.

Additionally, {ADDITIONAL_IMPROVEMENT}.
```

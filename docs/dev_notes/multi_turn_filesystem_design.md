## Core Concepts

### Turn-Based Workflow

Each user interaction in a multi-turn conversation represents one **turn**:
- **Turn 1**: Initial user request → agent processes → results saved to `sessions/session_X/turn_1/`
- **Turn 2**: Follow-up request → agent has access to turn 1 results → results saved to `turn_2/`
- **Turn N**: Agent can reference all previous turns while building new work

### Session Structure

```
sessions/
└── session_20250927_123456/
    ├── SESSION_SUMMARY.txt           # Human-readable summary
    ├── turn_1/
    │   ├── workspace/                # Final output from turn 1
    │   ├── answer.txt                # Normalized answer with corrected paths
    │   └── metadata.json             # Turn metadata (timestamp, winning agent, task)
    ├── turn_2/
    │   ├── workspace/                # Final output from turn 2 (built on turn 1)
    │   ├── answer.txt
    │   └── metadata.json
    └── turn_3/
        └── ...
```

### Logging Structure

Logs mirror the session structure for easy correlation:

```
massgen_logs/
└── log_20250927_123456/
    ├── turn_1/
    │   └── massgen_debug.log         # All logs for turn 1
    ├── turn_2/
    │   └── massgen_debug.log         # All logs for turn 2
    └── turn_3/
        └── massgen_debug.log
```

**Key Design Point:** Logs for turn N go into `turn_N/` directory (not `turn_N-1/` or base dir).

---

## Architecture

### Component Responsibilities

#### 1. CLI (`massgen/cli.py`)
**Responsibilities:**
- Session ID generation and management
- Turn counter management
- Agent recreation with previous turn context paths
- Logging reconfiguration for each turn
- Calling session persistence after orchestrator completes

**Key Functions:**
- `run_interactive_mode()` - Main loop managing turns
- `load_previous_turns()` - Loads turn metadata from session storage
- `handle_session_persistence()` - Persists orchestrator results after each turn

#### 2. Orchestrator (`massgen/orchestrator.py`)
**Responsibilities:**
- Receives `previous_turns` list from CLI
- Pre-populates agent workspaces with turn N-1 results (writable copy)
- Provides turn information to agents via system messages
- Exposes `get_final_result()` for CLI to persist

**Key Methods:**
- `_clear_agent_workspaces()` - Clears and pre-populates workspaces
- `_get_previous_turns_context_paths()` - Returns turn metadata for system message
- `get_final_result()` - Returns final answer, winning agent, and workspace path

#### 3. Logger (`massgen/logger_config.py`)
**Responsibilities:**
- Creates turn-specific log directories
- Routes logs to correct turn directory

**Key Functions:**
- `get_log_session_dir(turn)` - Returns log directory for given turn
- `setup_logging(debug, log_file, turn)` - Configures logging for specific turn

---

## Workspace Access Patterns

### Dual-Access Design

Agents in turn N have **TWO ways** to access turn N-1 results:

#### 1. Writable Workspace (Pre-populated Copy)
- **Location**: Agent's own workspace directory (e.g., `workspace1/`)
- **Permission**: Read + Write
- **Content**: Complete copy of turn N-1's final workspace
- **Purpose**: Agent can modify, extend, or build upon previous work
- **Mechanism**: Orchestrator copies `turn_N-1/workspace/` → agent's workspace before execution

#### 2. Read-Only Context Path (Original)
- **Location**: Session storage (e.g., `sessions/.../turn_1/workspace/`)
- **Permission**: Read-only
- **Content**: Original, unmodified turn N-1 results
- **Purpose**: Agent can reference original state for comparison ("what did I change?")
- **Mechanism**: CLI adds previous turn as context path when recreating agents

### Example: Turn 3 Access Pattern

**Agent perspective during turn 3:**
```
My Workspace (writable):
  /path/to/workspace1/
  ├── file1.txt         # Copy from turn 2, can modify
  └── file2.txt         # Copy from turn 2, can modify

Read-Only Context Paths:
  /sessions/session_X/turn_1/workspace/  # Original turn 1 results
  /sessions/session_X/turn_2/workspace/  # Original turn 2 results (same as workspace copy)
```

**System Message Excerpt:**
```
**Your Workspace**: `/path/to/workspace1/` - Write actual files here.
**Note**: Your workspace already contains a writable copy of the previous
turn's results - you can modify or build upon these files. The original
unmodified version is also available as a read-only context path if you
need to reference what was originally there.

**Context Path**: `/sessions/.../turn_2/workspace` (read-only)
**Context Path**: `/sessions/.../turn_1/workspace` (read-only)

**Note**: This is a multi-turn conversation. Each User/Assistant exchange
in the conversation history represents one turn. The workspace from each
turn is available as a read-only context path listed above.
```

### Why Dual Access?

This design allows agents to:
1. **Iterate freely** on previous work (via writable workspace)
2. **Compare changes** by checking original vs. modified (via context paths)
3. **Reference older turns** without cluttering current workspace
4. **Maintain audit trail** of what changed in each turn

---

## Session Persistence

### Flow

1. **Orchestrator completes** → `get_final_result()` returns:
   - `final_answer`: Agent's response text
   - `winning_agent_id`: Which agent won
   - `workspace_path`: Temporary workspace location

2. **CLI calls `handle_session_persistence()`**:
   - Increments turn counter
   - Creates `sessions/session_X/turn_N/` directory
   - Normalizes answer paths (replaces temp paths with persistent paths)
   - Copies workspace to `turn_N/workspace/`
   - Saves `answer.txt` and `metadata.json`
   - Updates `SESSION_SUMMARY.txt`

3. **Returns** `(session_id, turn_number, normalized_answer)`

### Path Normalization

Agents work in temporary directories like `/tmp/workspace1/`. Before persistence:
```python
# Agent's answer references temporary path
"I created files in /tmp/workspace1/file.txt"

# After normalization
"I created files in /sessions/session_X/turn_1/workspace/file.txt"
```

This ensures conversation history has correct, persistent paths.

---

## Logging Design

### Original Problem

**Initial design (incorrect):**
- Turn 1 starts: `current_turn = 0` → logs go to base directory
- Turn 1 completes: increment to `current_turn = 1`, reconfigure logging
- Turn 2 starts: `current_turn = 1` → logs go to `turn_1/` (should be `turn_2/`)

**Result:** Logs were always one turn behind session directories.

### Solution

**Corrected design:**
- Turn starts: increment BEFORE processing, reconfigure logging immediately
- Turn 1 starts: `next_turn = 1`, reconfigure → logs go to `turn_1/`
- Turn 1 completes: persist to `sessions/.../turn_1/`

**Key code change in `cli.py`:**
```python
# BEFORE processing (not after)
next_turn = current_turn + 1
setup_logging(debug=_DEBUG_MODE, turn=next_turn)
reconfig_logger.info(f"Starting turn {next_turn}")

# Process turn...
response = await run_question_with_history(...)

# AFTER processing
current_turn = updated_turn  # Update from persistence result
```

### Benefits

1. **Aligned numbering**: `turn_1` logs match `turn_1` session directory
2. **No pre-creation**: Directories only created when turn actually starts
3. **Clear audit trail**: All logs for turn N in one place

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. CLI vs. Orchestrator Responsibility Split

**Decision:** CLI handles all session persistence, Orchestrator only exposes data

**Rationale:**
- Orchestrator is a reusable component used in various contexts (single-turn, multi-agent, etc.)
- Session persistence is specific to CLI's interactive mode
- Keeps orchestrator stateless between turns
- Allows other interfaces (API, UI) to implement their own persistence

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ Orchestrator handles persistence → Couples orchestrator to CLI's storage format
- ❌ Shared persistence service → Adds complexity without clear benefit

### 2. Agent Recreation vs. Workspace Update

**Decision:** Fully recreate agents with updated context paths before each turn

**Rationale:**
- MCP servers need to be initialized with correct context paths
- No clean way to "hotswap" MCP configuration without recreation
- Fresh agent state prevents cross-turn contamination

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Clean, predictable state
- ✅ MCPs properly configured
- ❌ Slower (requires backend cleanup and recreation)
- ❌ More complex code

**Future Improvement (TODO):**
```python
# Instead of recreation, if MCPs support dynamic reconfiguration:
if hasattr(agent.backend, 'update_context_paths'):
    agent.backend.update_context_paths(new_paths)
```

### 3. Workspace Pre-population

**Decision:** Orchestrator pre-populates agent workspaces with turn N-1

**Rationale:**
- Agents expect to "continue" work from previous turn
- Copying files is simpler than managing read-only mounts
- Allows agents to modify previous work directly

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ Read-only mount → Agents can't modify files, need complex copy logic
- ❌ No pre-population → Agents must manually copy files they want to modify

### 4. Dual Workspace Access (Writable + Read-Only)

**Decision:** Provide BOTH writable copy AND read-only original

**Rationale:**
- Enables comparison workflows ("what changed since last turn?")
- Supports verification tasks
- Maintains audit trail

**Cost:** Additional storage (one copy per turn), but worth it for flexibility

### 5. Turn Numbering Starts at 1

**Decision:** First turn is `turn_1`, not `turn_0`

**Rationale:**
- More intuitive for users ("Turn 1" sounds like first turn)
- Avoids confusion with zero-based indexing
- Matches common language ("Turn 1, Turn 2, ...")

### 6. Session ID Format

**Decision:** `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` timestamp-based

**Rationale:**
- Human-readable
- Sortable chronologically
- Unique (within second resolution)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ UUID → Less readable
- ❌ Sequential numbers → Requires persistent counter

  ↓
  session_info = {
      "session_id": "session_20250927_123456",
      "current_turn": 1,  # Previous turn number
      "session_storage": "sessions"
  }
  ↓
run_question_with_history()
  ↓
load_previous_turns(session_info)  # Loads turn_1, turn_2, etc.
  ↓
Orchestrator(__init__, previous_turns=[...])
  ↓
[Orchestrator executes]
  ↓
handle_session_persistence()
  ↓
Returns (session_id, turn_2, normalized_answer)  # Incremented turn
  ↓
CLI updates: current_turn = 2
```

---

## Final Architecture

**Clean separation of concerns:**
- **CLI:** Session management, persistence, agent lifecycle
- **Orchestrator:** Coordination logic, workspace pre-population, data exposure
- **Logger:** Turn-specific log routing
- **Message Templates:** System message generation with turn context

---

## Future Improvements

### 0. Increase the amount of turns that can be reliably done and implement a summary mechanic.
Currently, after some number of turns, MassGen may fail to reliably copy in the new files to the write context path when it is provided.
We need to address this challenge, possibly changing the amount of context we display and/or how we display it.
We also want to implement a summarization function similar to `/compact` in Claude Code.

### 1. Optimized Agent Recreation
Instead of full recreation, support dynamic MCP reconfiguration:
```python
# Pseudocode
if agent.backend.supports_dynamic_context_paths():
    agent.backend.update_context_paths(new_turn_paths)
else:
    # Fall back to recreation
    agent = recreate_agent_with_paths(new_turn_paths)
```

### 2. Turn Branching
Support branching from previous turns:
```
turn_1 → turn_2 → turn_3a (try approach A)
              ↓
              → turn_3b (try approach B)
```

### 3. Turn Diff Visualization
Show what changed between turns:
```bash
massgen diff turn_1 turn_2
# Shows added/modified/deleted files
```

### 4. Turn Rollback
Ability to continue from an earlier turn:
```bash
massgen continue-from turn_2
# Discards turn_3, continues from turn_2
```

## Summary

Multi-turn filesystem support enables agents to build upon previous work across conversation turns. The design emphasizes:

1. **Clear separation of concerns** - CLI manages persistence, Orchestrator manages coordination
2. **Dual workspace access** - Writable copy for iteration + read-only original for comparison
3. **Aligned logging** - Turn N logs match turn N session directories
4. **Audit trail** - Complete history of work, changes, and decisions
5. **Flexibility** - Agents can reference any previous turn via context paths

This architecture provides a foundation for complex multi-turn workflows while maintaining clean abstractions and avoiding tight coupling between components.

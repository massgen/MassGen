---

## Conclusion

The MassGen documentation is **strong overall**, especially for core multi-agent coordination, MCP integration, AG2 framework, and file operations. However, some important features from recent releases (multimodal support, local inference backends, logging details) are missing or under-documented in the user guide.

**Priority:** Focus on documenting user-facing features that significantly impact functionality:
1. Multimodal capabilities (v0.0.27)
2. Local inference backends (v0.0.24-0.0.25)
3. Enhanced logging and coordination tracking (v0.0.13-0.0.19)

These additions will significantly improve feature discoverability and user experience.

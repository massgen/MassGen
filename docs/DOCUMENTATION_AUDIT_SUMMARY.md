# MassGen Documentation Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

---

## Critical Finding

**The majority of MassGen's user-facing documentation describes a fictional Python API that does not exist.**

MassGen is a **CLI tool with YAML configuration**, not a Python library. Users following the current documentation will fail immediately.

---

## What's Wrong

### 8 Files Contain Completely Fictional Content

1. **quickstart/configuration.rst** - Shows fake Python API instead of real YAML
2. **user_guide/backends.rst** - Documents non-existent backend classes
3. **user_guide/tools.rst** - Shows fictional tool imports and classes
4. **user_guide/advanced_usage.rst** - Entire file is made-up features
5. **examples/basic_examples.rst** - All examples are fictional
6. **examples/advanced_patterns.rst** - All examples are fictional
7. **examples/case_studies.rst** - All examples are fictional

### Example of The Problem

**Current Docs Say:**
```python
from massgen import Agent, Orchestrator
from massgen.backends import OpenAIBackend

agent = Agent(name="MyAgent", backend=OpenAIBackend(model="gpt-4"))
orchestrator = Orchestrator(agents=[agent])
```

**This Code Does Not Work** - These classes don't exist.

**Reality:**
```bash
uv run python -m massgen.cli \
  --config massgen/configs/basic/multi/three_agents_default.yaml \
  "Your question"
```

## What's Correct

### 11 Files Are Accurate (Recently Created)

‚úÖ **index.rst** - Rewritten, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/concepts.rst** - Rewritten, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/multi_turn_mode.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/file_operations.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/project_integration.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/ag2_integration.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **user_guide/mcp_integration.rst** - Rewritten, accurate
‚úÖ **quickstart/running-massgen.rst** - Accurate
‚úÖ **reference/cli.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **reference/yaml_schema.rst** - NEW, accurate
‚úÖ **reference/supported_models.rst** - NEW, accurate

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Delete or Deprecate (Today)

Add warnings to these files:
- quickstart/configuration.rst
- user_guide/backends.rst
- user_guide/tools.rst
- user_guide/advanced_usage.rst
- examples/basic_examples.rst
- examples/advanced_patterns.rst
- examples/case_studies.rst

**Warning text:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This documentation is outdated and describes a fictional API.
MassGen is a CLI tool, not a Python library. See README.md for accurate information.
```

### 2. Rewrite Core Files (This Week)

**Priority 1:**
- configuration.rst ‚Üí Real YAML configuration examples
- backends.rst ‚Üí Backend configuration in YAML
- basic_examples.rst ‚Üí Real CLI commands

**Priority 2:**
- tools.rst ‚Üí Tools and capabilities (YAML-based)
- Create: mcp_examples.rst (from README)
- Create: ag2_examples.rst (from v0.0.28 release notes)

**Priority 3:**
- advanced_usage.rst ‚Üí Advanced features (planning mode, multi-turn, etc.)
- Navigation cleanup (move tracks/RFCs to separate section)

---

## Navigation Simplification

### Current Problem

User Guide mixes:
- Real guides (concepts, multi_turn, MCP, files)
- Fictional guides (backends, tools, advanced_usage)
- Project management (tracks/, decisions/, rfcs/)

### Recommended Structure

```
Getting Started
  - installation ‚úÖ
  - running-massgen ‚úÖ
  - configuration (REWRITE)

User Guide
  - concepts ‚úÖ
  - multi_turn_mode ‚úÖ
  - mcp_integration ‚úÖ
  - file_operations ‚úÖ
  - project_integration ‚úÖ
  - ag2_integration ‚úÖ

Reference
  - cli ‚úÖ
  - yaml_schema ‚úÖ
  - supported_models ‚úÖ

Examples
  - basic_examples (REWRITE)
  - mcp_examples (NEW)
  - ag2_examples (NEW)

Project Coordination (For Contributors)
  - tracks/
  - decisions/
  - rfcs/
```

## Verification Against Releases

### v0.0.28 (AG2 Integration - Oct 6, 2025)
- ‚úÖ ag2_integration.rst exists and is accurate
- ‚ùå No examples in docs (examples/ is fictional)
- ‚úÖ README.md has full AG2 documentation

### v0.0.29 (MCP Planning Mode - Oct 8, 2025)
- ‚úÖ mcp_integration.rst mentions planning mode
- ‚ùå Not in advanced_usage.rst (fictional file)
- ‚úÖ README.md has full planning mode documentation

**Conclusion:** Release features are documented in README but not in docs.

---

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

1. **README.md** - Authoritative, comprehensive, accurate
2. **Release notes** - What's new (v0.0.28, v0.0.29)
3. **Docs** - Should expand on README with details
4. **API reference** - Auto-generated from code

**Current Problem:** Docs contradict README with fictional content.

---

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1:** Deprecation warnings - 1 hour
- **Phase 2:** Rewrite critical paths - 4 hours
- **Phase 3:** Complete user guide - 3 hours
- **Phase 4:** Navigation cleanup - 1 hour
- **Phase 5:** Verification - 2 hours

**Total:** 11 hours

---

## Success Criteria

Documentation is fixed when:

1. ‚úÖ All examples work (can copy-paste and run)
2. ‚úÖ No contradictions with README.md
3. ‚úÖ v0.0.29 features documented
4. ‚úÖ Simple navigation (user docs vs project management)
5. ‚úÖ README.md recognized as authoritative source

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. Add deprecation warnings to fictional files
2. Update index.rst to de-emphasize broken docs
3. Start rewriting configuration.rst

### This Week
1. Complete rewrites of configuration, backends, basic examples
2. Create new MCP and AG2 example pages
3. Simplify navigation structure

### Ongoing
1. Establish README.md as single source of truth
2. Add comments in docs: "Source: README.md section X"
3. Quarterly audits to prevent drift

---

## Key Insight

**The problem isn't missing documentation - it's completely incorrect documentation.**

The accurate guides you recently created (multi_turn_mode.rst, file_operations.rst, etc.) prove that correct documentation is possible. The issue is that older files describe a completely different system architecture than what actually exists.

**Solution:** Rewrite fictional files to match the CLI+YAML reality documented in README.md.

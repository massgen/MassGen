# MassGen v0.1.3 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.1.3 focuses on general interoperability and enterprise collaboration capabilities. Key priorities include:

- **General Interoperability** (Required): üîÑ Enable MassGen to orchestrate agents from multiple frameworks with unified interface
- **Final Agent Submit/Restart Tools** (Required): üîÅ Enable final agent to intelligently decide whether to submit or restart orchestration

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **General Interoperability**: Framework integration with external agent frameworks (nested/group chat patterns) and custom agent adapters
2. **Final Agent Submit/Restart**: Multi-step task verification with intelligent restart capabilities

## Key Milestones

### üéØ Milestone 1: General Interoperability (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Enable MassGen to orchestrate agents from multiple external frameworks and custom implementations

**Owner**: @qidanrui (danrui2020)

**Issue**: [#341](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/341)

#### 1.1 Unified Agent Interface
- [ ] Design framework-agnostic agent adapter interface
- [ ] Implement base adapter class for external frameworks
- [ ] Support message translation between frameworks
- [ ] Handle framework-specific capabilities and tools

#### 1.2 Framework Integration
- [ ] Design and implement framework integration architecture
- [ ] Support external agent systems with unified interface
- [ ] Enable seamless orchestration across frameworks
- [ ] Handle framework-specific communication patterns

#### 1.3 Testing and Examples
- [ ] Create tests for framework integration
- [ ] Add example configurations for multi-framework teams
- [ ] Document best practices for framework integration
- [ ] Test with specialized agent roles from different frameworks

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Framework integration functional with unified interface
- ‚úÖ Seamless orchestration across external agent systems
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation with examples

### üéØ Milestone 2: Final Agent Submit/Restart Tools (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Enable final agent to intelligently decide whether to submit answer or restart orchestration for multi-step verification

**Owner**: @ncrispino (nickcrispino)

**Issue**: [#325](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/325)

#### 2.1 Submit/Restart Architecture
- [ ] Design final agent decision-making interface
- [ ] Implement restart tool allowing orchestration reset
- [ ] Add submit tool for final answer presentation
- [ ] Handle state management between restarts

#### 2.2 Context Access
- [ ] Enable final agent access to previous agents' responses
- [ ] Support workspace access from prior orchestration rounds
- [ ] Implement context aggregation for informed decisions
- [ ] Add history tracking for restart decisions

#### 2.3 Verification Workflows
- [ ] Support multi-step task verification patterns
- [ ] Enable planning-mode scenarios with restart logic
- [ ] Add completion criteria evaluation
- [ ] Implement intelligent retry strategies

#### 2.4 Testing and Examples
- [ ] Create tests for submit/restart workflows
- [ ] Add configuration examples for verification tasks
- [ ] Document use cases (repository cloning + issue resolution)
- [ ] Test with various multi-step scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Final agent can decide to restart when task incomplete
- ‚úÖ Previous context accessible during restarts
- ‚úÖ Verification workflows functional
- ‚úÖ Documentation with practical examples

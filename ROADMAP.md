## üìã v0.1.7 - Agent Task Planning & Rate Limiting

### Features

**1. Agent Task Planning System** (@ncrispino)
- PR: [#385](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/pull/385) (Draft)
- Enable agents to organize complex multi-step work with task plans
- 8 new MCP planning tools for task management and dependency tracking
- Automatic task status tracking and progress monitoring
- Configurable via `enable_agent_task_planning` flag
- Maximum 100 tasks per plan for safety
- **Use Case**: Complex multi-step workflows requiring task decomposition, dependency management, and coordinated execution across multiple agents

**2. Gemini Rate Limiting System** (@AbhimanyuAryan)
- PR: [#383](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/pull/383) (Draft)
- Multi-dimensional rate limiting for Gemini models (RPM, TPM, RPD)
- Model-specific limits: Flash (9 RPM), Pro (2 RPM)
- Sliding window tracking for precise rate management
- External YAML configuration for centralized limit control
- Optional `--rate-limit` CLI flag to enable/disable
- Mandatory cooldown after agent startup to prevent API bursts
- **Use Case**: Prevent API spam and manage costs while ensuring smooth operation within Gemini's rate limits

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Task planning tools enable multi-step workflows with dependencies
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting prevents API quota violations and manages costs
- ‚úÖ Both features are configurable and well-documented

---

## üìã v0.1.8 - Intelligent Optimization

### Features

**1. DSPy Integration** (@praneeth999)
- Issue: [#316](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/316)
- Automated system prompt optimization for case studies
- Question rephrasing for increased diversity and clarity
- **Use Case**: Improve agent performance on domain-specific tasks through automated prompt tuning

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ DSPy-optimized prompts outperform manual prompts on benchmarks

---

## üìã v0.1.9 - Computer Use Agent

### Features

**1. Computer Use Agent Integration** (@qidanrui)
- Issue: [#358](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/358)
- Computer use agent integration with custom tools system
- Enable agents to interact with computer interfaces
- **Use Case**: Automated UI testing, browser automation, and desktop application interaction

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Computer use agent successfully integrated with custom tools

---

## üìã v0.1.1 - Tool System & Infrastructure

### Features

**1. Tool System Refactoring** (@qidanrui)
- Migrate workflow tools into unified tool system
- Migrate provider tools (web search, code execution) into tool system
- Migrate multimodal tools into tool system
- **Use Case**: Simplify adding new tools; enable custom tool plugins for domain-specific workflows

**2. Memory Module - Phase 1** (@kitrakrev)
- Long-term memory implementation using mem0 inspired by agentscope.
- **Use Case**: Reasoning tasks, large document/code understanding, ensuring quality of many-turn conversations

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All tools migrated to unified system
- ‚úÖ Memory module handles basic context management

---

## üìã v0.1.2 - Enterprise Collaboration

### Features

**1. Finish AG2 Group Chat Integration** (@Eric-Shang)
- Group chat orchestration patterns:
  - Summarization method
  - AutoPattern
  - Round robin pattern
  - Nested chat
- **Use Case**: Complex research workflows requiring specialized agent roles (researcher, analyst, critic, synthesizer) in already-proven AG2 patterns

**2. Final Agent Submit/Restart Tools** (@ncrispino)
- Issue: [#325](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/325)
- Enable final agent to decide whether to submit answer or restart orchestration
- Agent can access previous agents' responses and workspaces when restarting
- **Use Case**: Multi-step tasks where completion requires verification (repository cloning + issue resolution, planning-mode scenarios)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Final agent can intelligently decide to restart when task is incomplete
- ‚úÖ Documentation with use case examples

---

## üìã v0.1.3 - Intelligent Optimization & Safety

### Features

**1. DSPy Integration** (@praneeth999)
- Automated system prompt optimization for case studies
- Question rephrasing for increased diversity and clarity
- Issue: [#316](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/316)
- **Use Case**: Improve agent performance on domain-specific tasks through automated prompt tuning

**2. Irreversible Actions Safety** (@franklinnwren)
- LLM-generated detection of irreversible MCP tools
- Optional human-in-the-loop approval
- Per-user customizable tool lists
- **Use Case**: Writing to real-world documents, database operations, production deployments where safety is critical

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ DSPy-optimized prompts outperform manual prompts on benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Safety controls prevent accidental irreversible operations

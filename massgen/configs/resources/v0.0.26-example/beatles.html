                The relationship between Bob Dylan and The Beatles is one of the most significant intersections
                in popular music history. Dylan's poetic lyrics and folk-rock sound profoundly influenced
                The Beatles, particularly John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were already fans of his work.

                Their most famous meeting occurred on August 28, 1964, at the Delmonico Hotel in New York City,
                arranged by journalist Al Aronowitz. It was during this legendary encounter that Dylan famously
                introduced The Beatles to marijuana, an event that many believe shifted their songwriting towards
                more introspective and experimental themes.

                The influence was mutual. While The Beatles adopted more profound lyrical themes and acoustic elements,
                Dylan, in turn, embraced electric instrumentation, inspired in part by The Beatles' massive success
                with rock and roll. This cross-pollination led to the birth of folk-rock and pushed both artists
                to new creative heights.

                Their friendship, though not always in the public eye, continued through the years,
                with both acts often acknowledging each other's impact. Their combined legacies
                irrevocably changed the landscape of popular music forever.

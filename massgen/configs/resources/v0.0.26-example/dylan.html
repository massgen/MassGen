            <h2>About Bob Dylan</h2>
            <p>
                Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist.
                Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure
                in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years. Part of the folk music revival of the 1960s,
                his songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the mid-1960s, Dylan alienated many of his early fans by adopting electric instrumentation
                and incorporating rock elements into his music. His lyrics, at times surreal and philosophical,
                drew on a wide range of literary, philosophical, and political influences.
                He has released many critically acclaimed albums, including "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" (1963),
                "Highway 61 Revisited" (1965), and "Blonde on Blonde" (1966). His "Never Ending Tour" has seen him perform constantly since the late 1980s.

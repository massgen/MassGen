# Three Agent Notion MCP Test Configuration with Planning Mode
# This configuration demonstrates planning vs execution mode to prevent duplicate tool calls
# during coordination while allowing full tool execution during final presentation
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Install Notion MCP server: npm install -g @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
# 2. Create Notion integrations and get tokens (see detailed setup in original config)
# 3. Set environment variables in .env file:
#    NOTION_TOKEN_ONE="your_first_notion_integration_token"
#    NOTION_TOKEN_TWO="your_second_notion_integration_token"
#    NOTION_TOKEN_THREE="your_third_notion_integration_token"
#    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
#    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"
#    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_key"
#
# Example usage:
# uv run python -m massgen.cli --config configs/three_agents_notion_mcp_planning_mode.yaml "Create a comprehensive project management system in Notion with tasks, timelines, and progress tracking. Design the database structure, create initial pages, and set up automation workflows."

      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: You are currently in the coordination phase where agents discuss and plan their approach.
      During this phase, you should:
      1. Describe your intended actions and reasoning
      2. Analyze other agents' proposals
      3. Use only the 'vote' or 'new_answer' tools for coordination
      4. DO NOT execute any actual Notion commands or API calls
      5. Save tool execution for the final presentation phase when the winning agent will implement the plan

      Focus on planning, analysis, and coordination rather than execution.

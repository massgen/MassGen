# Example: Docker with SSH Keys for Private Repository Access
#
# This example shows how to clone and work with private GitHub repositories
# using your SSH keys mounted into the Docker container.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Docker daemon running
# 2. SSH keys set up (~/.ssh/id_rsa with correct permissions)
# 3. Git config with your name/email (~/.gitconfig)
# 4. SSH key added to GitHub account
# 5. Build the Docker image: bash massgen/docker/build.sh
#
# Usage:
#   uv run massgen massgen/configs/tools/code-execution/docker_private_repo_clone.yaml "Test SSH setup and clone a private repo if you have one (replace yourorg/private-repo with real repo)"
#
# Note: Replace "yourorg/private-repo" with an actual private repo you have access to

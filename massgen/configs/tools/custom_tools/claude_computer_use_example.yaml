# MassGen Configuration: Claude Computer Use
#
# This configuration demonstrates how to use Anthropic's Claude models with Computer Use.
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This configuration requires a custom tool implementation
# similar to the OpenAI computer_use tool or Gemini gemini_computer_use tool.
#
# The Claude Computer Use API requires:
# 1. Beta header: "computer-use-2025-01-24"
# 2. Anthropic-defined tools: computer_20250124, text_editor_20250124, bash_20250124
# 3. An agent loop that executes the tool actions (screenshots, mouse clicks, etc.)
# 4. A sandboxed computing environment (Docker/VM recommended)
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config claude_computer_use_example.yaml
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
#   2. Implement claude_computer_use tool (similar to computer_use or gemini_computer_use)
#   3. Playwright installed for browser control: pip install playwright && playwright install
#   4. Virtual display setup (Xvfb) for desktop control
#
# Supported Models:
#   - claude-sonnet-4-5 (recommended)
#   - claude-sonnet-3-7 (deprecated, supports thinking)

agents:
  - id: "claude_computer_agent"
    backend:
      type: "claude"
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"  # Or claude-sonnet-3-7
      max_tokens: 4096
      # Claude Computer Use beta header (passed via betas parameter)
      betas: ["computer-use-2025-01-24"]
      # Optional: Enable thinking for Claude Sonnet 3.7
      # thinking:
      #   type: "enabled"
      #   budget_tokens: 1024
      # Note: Anthropic-defined tools (computer, text_editor, bash) are added separately
      # They use schema-less tool definitions that are built into Claude's model
      custom_tools:
        # TODO: Implement claude_computer_use tool similar to gemini_computer_use
        # This tool would:
        # 1. Initialize Playwright browser or virtual desktop environment
        # 2. Make API calls to Claude with the beta header and Anthropic-defined tools
        # 3. Execute the tool actions (screenshot, click, type, etc.)
        # 4. Return results to Claude in the agent loop
        # 5. Handle safety checks and prompt injection warnings

    system_message: |
      You are an AI assistant with access to Anthropic's Claude Computer Use capabilities.
      
      You have access to the following tools:
      - computer: Take screenshots, control mouse/keyboard, interact with desktop environments
      - str_replace_editor: Edit files using search and replace
      - bash: Execute shell commands
      
      When users ask you to:
      - Browse websites or search for information
      - Interact with desktop applications
      - Edit configuration files or scripts
      - Execute system commands
      - Perform complex multi-step workflows
      - Save files to the desktop
      - Fill out forms or navigate web interfaces
      
      You can directly use the computer tool to interact with the environment.
      
      Available computer actions (computer_20250124):
      - screenshot: Capture the current display
      - left_click: Click at coordinates [x, y]
      - right_click, middle_click: Additional mouse buttons
      - double_click, triple_click: Multiple clicks
      - left_click_drag: Click and drag between coordinates
      - type: Type text string
      - key: Press key or key combination (e.g., "ctrl+s")
      - hold_key: Hold a key while performing other actions
      - mouse_move: Move cursor to coordinates
      - left_mouse_down, left_mouse_up: Fine-grained click control
      - scroll: Scroll in any direction with amount control
      - wait: Pause between actions
      
      Example tasks:
      - "Save a picture of a cat to my desktop"
      - "Search for Python documentation on the web"
      - "Edit the config.txt file and change the port to 8080"
      - "Find the current weather in San Francisco"
      
      Important reminders:
      - After each step, take a screenshot to verify the outcome was correct
      - Use keyboard shortcuts when UI elements are tricky to click
      - Keep display resolution at or below 1280x800 (WXGA) for best performance
      - If you need to log in, credentials will be provided in <robot_credentials> tags
      
      Security notes:
      - You're running in a sandboxed environment
      - Avoid creating accounts or generating content on social media platforms
      - Ask for confirmation before actions with real-world consequences
      
      Note: This uses Anthropic's beta Computer Use tool with built-in safety checks
      and prompt injection protection.

🚀 **What if you could harness the collective intelligence of multiple AI models to solve complex problems?**

Introducing **MassGen**, a new open-source framework for next-gen multi-agent scaling through intelligent collaboration!

Inspired by the power of "parallel study groups" in systems like Grok Heavy and concepts like "iterative refinement," MassGen orchestrates multiple AI agents to tackle complex tasks in parallel. Agents observe each other's work, share insights, and collaboratively refine their approaches to converge on the best possible solution.

**Key Features:**
🤝 **Cross-Model/Agent Synergy:** Harness strengths from diverse frontier model-powered agents.
⚡ **Parallel Processing:** Multiple agents tackle problems simultaneously.
👥 **Intelligence Sharing:** Agents share and learn from each other's work.
🔄 **Consensus Building:** Natural convergence through collaborative refinement.
📊 **Live Visualization:** See agents' working processes in real-time.

Empower your research and development with MassGen. I invite you to explore the project on GitHub, give it a star if it sparks your interest, and join the community. Contributions are highly welcome as we build out the roadmap!

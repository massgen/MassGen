# MassGen v0.1.4 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.1.4 focuses on Docker integration and enhanced coding capabilities. Key priorities include:

- **Running MCP Tools in Docker** (Required): üê≥ Containerized execution environment for MCP tools with enhanced security and isolation
- **Enhanced File Operations** (Required): üìÅ Advanced workspace management for coding agents

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Running MCP Tools in Docker**: Containerized execution environment for MCP tools, enhanced security and isolation
   **Use Case**: Secure execution of third-party tools in isolated environments
2. **Enhanced File Operations**: Advanced file handling and workspace management for coding agents
   **Use Case**: Complex coding tasks requiring sophisticated file manipulation

## Key Milestones

### üéØ Milestone 1: Running MCP Tools in Docker (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Containerized execution environment for MCP tools with enhanced security and isolation

**Owner**: @ncrispino (nickcrispino)

### üéØ Milestone 2: Move Image/Audio/Video Generation Tools to Customized Tool System (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Refactor existing media generation capabilities to integrate with customized tool system

**Owner**: @qidanrui (danrui2020)

**Issue**: [#357](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/357)

#### 2.1 Tool System Refactoring
- [ ] Extract image generation tools to custom tool system
- [ ] Extract audio generation tools to custom tool system
- [ ] Extract video generation tools to custom tool system
- [ ] Standardize tool interface across media types

#### 2.2 Integration and Compatibility
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing implementations
- [ ] Update backend configurations to use new tool system
- [ ] Maintain feature parity with current generation tools
- [ ] Add tool discovery and registration mechanisms

#### 2.3 Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Document new tool system architecture
- [ ] Provide migration guide for existing users
- [ ] Create example configurations using new tools
- [ ] Update API documentation

#### 2.4 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for media generation tools

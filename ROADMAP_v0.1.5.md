# MassGen v0.1.5 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.1.5 focuses on memory implementation for agents and backend code refactoring. Key priorities include:

- **Handle Context Limit Overflow** (Required): üß† Implement strategies to manage context when it exceeds limits
- **Persistent Memory Across Restarts** (Required): üíæ Short and long-term memory implementation that persists across sessions
- **Backend Code Refactoring** (Required): üîß Major code refactoring for improved maintainability and developer experience

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Handle Context Limit Overflow**: Automatic context management, truncation strategies, and graceful handling of context limits
   **Use Case**: Enable agents to work on long-running tasks without hitting context limits
2. **Persistent Memory Across Restarts**: Memory persistence system for maintaining agent state and learning across restarts
   **Use Case**: Maintain continuity in agent reasoning and learning across sessions
3. **Backend Code Refactoring**: Major backend code improvements for better architecture and maintainability
   **Use Case**: Improved developer experience and easier future enhancements

# MassGen v0.1.5 Roadmap

## Overview

Version 0.1.5 focuses on Docker integration for MCP tools and backend code refactoring. Key priorities include:

- **Running MCP Tools in Docker** (Required): üê≥ Containerized execution environment for MCP tools with enhanced security and isolation
- **Backend Code Refactoring** (Required): üîß Major code refactoring for improved maintainability and developer experience

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Running MCP Tools in Docker**: Containerized execution environment for MCP tools, enhanced security and isolation
   **Use Case**: Secure execution of third-party tools in isolated environments
2. **Backend Code Refactoring**: Major backend code improvements for better architecture and maintainability
   **Use Case**: Improved developer experience and easier future enhancements

## Key Milestones

### üéØ Milestone 1: Running MCP Tools in Docker (REQUIRED)

**Goal**: Containerized execution environment for MCP tools with enhanced security and isolation

**Owner**: @ncrispino (nickcrispino)

**Issue**: [#346](https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/346)

#### 1.1 Docker Integration Architecture
- [ ] Design containerized execution environment for MCP tools
- [ ] Implement Docker manager for MCP tool execution
- [ ] Support for isolated MCP server instances
- [ ] Handle container lifecycle management

#### 1.2 Security and Isolation
- [ ] Enhanced security layers for Docker execution
- [ ] Network isolation for MCP servers
- [ ] Resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers
- [ ] Secure volume mounts for workspace access

#### 1.3 Testing and Examples
- [ ] Create tests for Docker-based MCP execution
- [ ] Add example configurations for Docker MCP servers
- [ ] Document Docker setup and security best practices
- [ ] Test with various MCP tools in isolated environments

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ MCP tools run securely in Docker containers
- ‚úÖ Enhanced isolation for third-party tools
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation with examples

## Future Enhancements (Post-v0.1.5)

### v0.1.6 Plans
- **General Interoperability**: Framework integration for external agent systems
- **Memory Module - Phase 1**: Long-term memory for reasoning tasks and document understanding

### v0.1.7 Plans
- **DSPy Integration**: Automated prompt optimization for domain-specific tasks
- **Computer Use Agent**: Automated UI testing and browser automation

### Long-term Vision
- **Visual Workflow Designer**: No-code multi-agent workflow creation
- **Enterprise Features**: RBAC, audit logs, multi-user collaboration
- **Complete Multimodal Pipeline**: End-to-end audio/video processing
- **Additional Framework Integrations**: LangChain, CrewAI, custom adapters
